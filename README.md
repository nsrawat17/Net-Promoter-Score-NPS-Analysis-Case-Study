# Net-Promoter-Score-NPS-Analysis-Case-Study
📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to calculate and analyze Net Promoter Score (NPS) using survey data collected from 500 respondents. NPS is a widely used metric to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty based on a simple rating scale (0–10).

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset NPS_Survey_Dataset_500.csv contains the following fields:

Customer_ID – Unique customer identifier

Rating – Customer rating on a scale of 0 to 10

Feedback – Textual feedback from the customer

Date – Date of survey response

Age, Gender, Location – Demographic info (for optional segmentation)

🧮 What is NPS?
NPS categorizes customers into:

Promoters (9–10): Loyal customers who promote your brand

Passives (7–8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic

Detractors (0–6): Unhappy customers who may damage your brand

Formula:
NPS = (% Promoters - % Detractors)

✅ Project Goals
Load and explore the dataset
Categorize customer ratings into Promoters, Passives, and Detractors
Calculate the overall NPS
Visualize distribution of ratings

🔧 Tools Used

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) for visualization
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

📌 Results

In this initial dataset, the calculated NPS score is -43%, indicating a larger share of detractors than promoters.
